## Features

**Profile-based simplicity** - Transform complex curl commands into simple, memorable requests. Store connection details, authentication, and headers in `~/.webly/profile` once, then use clean relative URLs like `webly -p prod GET /api/users` instead of repeating lengthy curl parameters every time.

Plus all the HTTP client features you expect:

- **Multiple HTTP methods** - Support GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, etc.
- **Authentication support** - Basic auth, custom headers
- **SSL/TLS support** - Custom CA certificates, insecure mode option
- **Proxy support** - HTTP proxy configuration  
- **Standard input support** - Read request body from stdin
- **Multiple compression** - gzip, deflate, zstd
- **Flexible URL handling** - Absolute or relative URLs with profile base
- **Verbose mode** - Detailed request/response information

No additional dependencies required - webly is a single, self-contained binary.

## Configuration

### Configuration File Location

webly looks for configuration in `~/.webly/profile`.

### Configuration Format

The configuration file uses INI format with multiple profiles. Each profile contains connection details and default headers.

```ini
[default]
host = https://api.example.com
user = your-username
password = your-password
insecure = false
ca_cert = /path/to/ca.pem
@content-type = application/json
@user-agent = webly/0.1
@accept = application/json
@accept-encoding = gzip, deflate

[staging]
host = https://staging-api.example.com  
user = staging-user
password = staging-pass
@content-type = application/json

[local]
host = http://localhost:8080
user = admin
password = admin
```

### Configuration Options

#### Connection Settings

- `host` - Base URL for requests (required for relative URLs)
- `user` - Username for basic authentication
- `password` - Password for basic authentication
- `ca_cert` - Path to CA certificate file for SSL/TLS
- `insecure` - Skip SSL/TLS certificate verification (true/false)

#### HTTP Headers

Any key starting with `@` becomes an HTTP header. Please feel free to add any custom headers you need.

Examples:

- `@content-type` → `Content-Type` header
- `@authorization` → `Authorization` header
- `@user-agent` → `User-Agent` header
- `@accept` → `Accept` header

### Profile Selection

```bash
# Use default profile
webly GET /api/endpoint

# Use specific profile
webly -p staging GET /api/endpoint
webly --profile production GET /api/endpoint
```

### Override with Command Line Options

Command line options override profile settings:

```bash
# Override user from profile
webly -p staging --user different-user GET /api/data

# Override host entirely
webly GET https://completely-different-host.com/api
```

## Quick Start

1. **Create a profile for your favorite API:**

   ```bash
   # Create ~/.webly directory and profile file
   mkdir -p ~/.webly
   echo "[swapi]
   host = https://swapi.dev/api
   @content-type = application/json" > ~/.webly/profile
   ```

2. **Use the profile to explore the Star Wars universe:**

   ```bash
   # Now you can use short URLs to explore the galaxy!
   webly -p swapi GET /people/1/        # Luke Skywalker
   webly -p swapi GET /people/4/        # Darth Vader
   webly -p swapi GET /starships/10/    # Millennium Falcon
   webly -p swapi GET /films/1/         # A New Hope
   ```

3. **Or override with full URLs when needed:**

   ```bash
   # You can always use absolute URLs to override the profile
   webly GET https://httpbin.org/get
   webly GET https://swapi.dev/api/planets/
   ```

## Usage

### Basic HTTP Requests

The simplest usage is to make a request to any URL:

```bash
# GET request
webly GET https://httpbin.org/get

# POST request with JSON data
webly POST https://httpbin.org/post '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
}'

# PUT request
webly PUT https://httpbin.org/put '{"status": "updated"}'

# DELETE request
webly DELETE https://httpbin.org/delete
```

### Using Standard Input

You can pass request body via standard input:

```bash
# From file
cat data.json | webly POST https://api.example.com/users

# From command output
echo '{"query": {"match_all": {}}}' | webly POST https://elasticsearch.example.com/my-index/_search

# Complex pipeline example
echo '{
    "query": {
        "range": {
            "@timestamp": {
                "gte": "now-1d/d",
                "lt": "now/d"
            }
        }
    }
}' | webly GET my-index/_search | jq '.hits.hits[]._source.name'
```

### Profile-Based Requests

Use profile to avoid repeating connection details:

```bash
# Use default profile
webly GET /api/users

# Use specific profile
webly -p staging GET /api/users
webly -p production GET /health
```

### Authentication & Headers

```bash
# Basic authentication
webly GET https://api.example.com/protected \
    --user admin \
    --password secret

# Custom headers
webly POST https://api.example.com/data \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token" \
    -H "X-Custom-Header: value" \
    '{"data": "value"}'

# SSL options
webly GET https://self-signed.example.com/api \
    --ca-cert /path/to/ca.pem \
    --insecure
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Through proxy
webly GET https://api.example.com/data \
    --proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080

# Verbose mode for debugging
webly -v GET https://api.example.com/debug

# Override profile settings
webly -p production GET /api/data \
    --user different-user \
    --password different-pass
```

### Shell Escaping

When using special characters in URLs or query parameters, you may need to escape them or use quotes:

```bash
# Query parameters with special characters - escape or quote
webly GET "/api/search?q=hello world&sort=date"
webly GET /api/search\?q=hello\ world\&sort=date

# Complex URLs with fragments
webly GET "https://api.example.com/items?filter=status:active&limit=10#results"

# JSON with special characters in URLs
webly POST "/api/items?category=tools&type=screws" '{
    "name": "Phillips head screw",
    "size": "M4"
}'
```

**Tip:** When in doubt, wrap URLs in double quotes to avoid shell interpretation issues.

For all available options, run:

```bash
webly --help
```

## Examples

### API Testing

```bash
# Test REST API endpoints
webly GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1
webly POST https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts '{
    "title": "My Post",
    "body": "Post content",
    "userId": 1
}'
```

### Working with Different Content Types

```bash
# JSON API
webly POST https://api.example.com/users \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    '{"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"}'

# Form data
webly POST https://api.example.com/form \
    -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    'name=John&email=john@example.com'

# File upload simulation
cat document.json | webly PUT https://api.example.com/documents/123
```

### Elasticsearch Examples

```bash
# Check cluster health
webly -p elastic GET /_cluster/health

# Search documents
echo '{
    "query": {
        "match": {"title": "search term"}
    }
}' | webly -p elastic GET /my-index/_search

# Index a document
webly -p elastic PUT /my-index/_doc/1 '{
    "title": "My Document",
    "content": "Document content here"
}'
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Set up profile for different environments
mkdir -p ~/.webly
cat > ~/.webly/profile << EOF
[dev]
host = http://localhost:3000
@content-type = application/json

[staging]
host = https://staging-api.company.com
user = api-user
password = staging-password
@authorization = Bearer staging-token

[prod]
host = https://api.company.com
user = api-user
password = production-password
@authorization = Bearer production-token
EOF

# Test the same endpoint across environments
webly -p dev GET /api/health
webly -p staging GET /api/health
webly -p prod GET /api/health
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: `webly: command not found`**
A: Make sure webly is in your PATH. Try `which webly` or reinstall following the installation instructions.

**Q: SSL certificate errors**
A: Use `--insecure` to skip certificate validation, or provide a CA certificate with `--ca-cert /path/to/ca.pem`.

**Q: Profile not found**
A: Check that `~/.webly/profile` exists and contains the profile. Use `webly -p nonexistent GET /` to see the error.

**Q: Authentication failures**
A: Verify credentials in your profile or override with `--user` and `--password` flags.

**Q: Request body from stdin not working**
A: Make sure you're piping data correctly: `echo '{"key": "value"}' | webly POST /api/endpoint`

### Debug Mode

Use verbose mode to see detailed request/response information:

```bash
webly -v GET https://httpbin.org/get
```

This shows:

- Full request URL and headers
- Response status and headers
- Timing information
- SSL/TLS details

### Configuration Validation

Check your configuration file:

```bash
# View current configuration
cat ~/.webly/profile

# Test with a simple request
webly -p your-profile GET /simple/endpoint
```

## Why webly and not curl?

I work with Elasticsearch clusters day in and day out. Kibana Dev Tools is ideal, but often unavailable in client environments where I need to SSH into nodes, check logs, and run diagnostic queries from the terminal.

`curl` works, but it becomes tedious with repetitive parameters:

```bash
curl -XGET -u elastic:password -H "content-type: application/json" \
     https://elastic-prod.es.us-central1.gcp.cloud.es.io/_cat/indices?v
```

In Kibana Dev Tools, this is simply:

```bash
GET /_cat/indices?v
```

I wanted that same simplicity in the terminal by bringing a profile system into it for easily switching between multiple clusters like `aws-cli`.

### Why Rust?

Python and Bash scripts work but become unwieldy and hard to maintain. Sometimes I even need to work with Python 2.6/2.7 that complicate the codes due to the compatibility issues. Rust works perfectly as:

- **Single binary** - No runtime dependencies, easy deployment
- **Performance** - Native speed, as fast as curl
- **Cross-platform** - Works on Linux and macOS
- **Reliability** - Memory safety and robust error handling
- **No compatibility hell** - Unlike Python scripts with version dependencies

## Contributing

### Development Setup

1. **Prerequisites**

   ```bash
   # Install Rust toolchain
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   source ~/.cargo/env
   ```

2. **Build from source**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samwisely75/webly.git
   cd webly
   cargo build
   ```

### Code Quality Tools

For contributors working on the codebase, we've set up automated tooling to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Automatically fix formatting and linting issues
make fix

# Or manually run individual steps:
cargo fmt                           # Format code
cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty    # Fix clippy warnings
cargo test                          # Run tests
```

The `make fix` command will:

- ✨ Format all code with `rustfmt`
- 🔧 Automatically fix clippy warnings (like `uninlined_format_args`)
- ✅ Verify all lints pass
- 🧪 Run the test suite to ensure nothing broke

**Pro tip:** Run `make fix` before committing to ensure your code passes CI!

### Other Make Targets

```bash
make help           # Show all available targets
make build          # Build the project  
make test           # Run tests
make lint           # Check linting only
make fmt            # Format code only
make check          # Run format + lint + test
```
